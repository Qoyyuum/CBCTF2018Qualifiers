# CyberBattle Capture The Flag 2018 Qualifiers Write Up

This is a write up from Team RFQ with myself as Q, Redzwan, and Faten for ITPSS Cyber Battle Capture The Flag 2018 Qualifiers.

Unfortunately, we didn't managed to get all of the questions or be qualified for the finals. This is a write up for the challenges presented in this repo.

Challenges provided into different categories:

* Packet Analysis
* Digital Forensics
* Web
* Exploitation
* Crypto

The challenges were online temporarily and accessible by the participants. This also means all the servers and vulnerable websites are inaccessible at this time of writing.

Enjoy reading my write up!
